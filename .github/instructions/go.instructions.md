# Go Code Style and Project Structure

Apply these instructions to all Go code in `src/`.

## Style priorities

- Prefer clarity, simplicity, maintainability, and consistency over clever code.
- Use standard language features and the standard library before introducing extra abstraction or dependencies.
- Keep local style consistent with nearby code unless that would worsen a deviation from the Google style guide.
- Format all Go code with `gofmt`; keep imports compatible with `goimports`.

## Project structure

- Keep all Go source code in `src/`.
- Keep `src/main.go` lightweight and focused on orchestration such as loading config, wiring dependencies, and starting the app.
- Put private application logic in `src/internal/**`.
- Put non-private packages in other `src/**` packages with short, descriptive package names.
- Keep acceptance tests in `src/acceptance-tests/`, with Gherkin feature files in `src/acceptance-tests/features/`. Acceptance tests are part of the main Go module - no separate `go.mod`.

## Naming

- Use short, descriptive, lowercase package names. Avoid underscores, dashes, mixed case, generic names like `util`, and unnecessary plurals.
- Use `PascalCase` for exported identifiers and `camelCase` for unexported identifiers.
- Prefer concise names that fit the local context and avoid stutter such as `user.Service` instead of `user.UserService`.
- Use short but meaningful local variable names.
- Use short, consistent receiver names.
- Keep interface names small and idiomatic; define interfaces where they are consumed.

## Functions and methods

- Keep functions small and focused on one responsibility.
- Prefer helper functions and better names over line-by-line comments that only restate the code.
- Use comments to explain why logic exists, important edge cases, or non-obvious trade-offs.
- Prefer the simplest implementation that keeps call sites easy to understand and hard to misuse.
- Long parameter lists. A method with eight parameters is doing too much, knows too much, or depends on too much. Get
nervous above four; refuse above six.

## Comments and documentation

- Use GoDoc-style `//` comments.
- Comment all exported packages, types, variables, constants, functions, and methods.
- Keep comments short, specific, and focused on behavior or rationale instead of narration.
- Avoid redundant comments that only describe what the code already says.
- Add a `PACKAGE.md` file to document the purpose of each package.

## Line-level comments

Avoid commenting on *what* the code does. Use comments to explain the *why* when the logic is non-obvious or complex. Prefer refactoring complex logic into well-named helper functions over adding inline comments.

```go
// Bad: comment only restates what the code already says
// check if restaurant exists in the system
if restaurant == nil {
    return err
}

// Good: extract intent into a well-named function
if err := checkRestaurantExists(restaurant); err != nil {
    return err
}
```

## Imports

Split imports into three groups separated by blank lines:

1. Standard library
2. Third-party dependencies
3. Local packages from `github.com/sommerfeld-io/github-metrics-exporter/src/...`

## Error handling

- Return `error` as the last return value from functions that can fail.
- Handle errors explicitly and early. Prefer the usual Go pattern:

```go
if err := someFunction(); err != nil {
    return err
}
```

- Avoid wrapping normal execution in `else` branches after an error check.
- Wrap lower-level errors with context by using `fmt.Errorf("context: %w", err)`.
- Define sentinel errors for expected failure cases that callers may need to detect.
- Lower-level packages should return or wrap errors, not log them.
- Boundary layers such as `main.go`, `server/`, or scraper entry points decide whether to log, convert, or terminate.
- Log errors to `stderr` and all non-error output to `stdout`, using structured logging whenever possible.
- Reserve `panic` for truly unrecoverable programmer or runtime faults, not normal control flow.

## Testing

- Follow TDD unconditionally. The test comes first - no exceptions.
- Keep unit tests next to the code they verify and use the `_test.go` suffix.
- Name tests with the `TestXxxShouldYyy` pattern.
- Cover happy paths, negative cases, and inversions so tests prove both what should and should not happen.
- Prefer table-driven tests when they improve clarity and reduce repetition.
- Use TDD as a Design Forcing Function: If a test is hard to write, do not power through, listen to the signal. Hard-to-write
tests almost always mean the code under test depends on too much. Refactor the design until the test is easy to write.
- Test Structure should follow the "Arrange -> Act -> Assert" pattern.
- As a validation, apply the Implementation-Swap Test: Ask, if I threw away this implementation and rewrote it from scratch, would my
tests still make sense? If yes, the tests are coupled to behaviour. If not, they are coupled to implementation. But do not actually throw anything away! Just use this as a sort of validation.

### Acceptance tests and Gherkin feature files

- `.feature` files define GoDog acceptance tests. They are **not** used to derive unit tests.
- Step definitions live in `src/acceptance-tests/*_steps_test.go`.
- Wire the GoDog suite in `src/acceptance-tests/suite_test.go`.
- Acceptance test Go code follows the same TDD discipline as production code. Any non-trivial
  helper extracted into a non-test file must have its own `*_test.go` unit tests.
- Unit test coverage is measured with `go test ./internal/...` and written to `coverage.out`.
  Acceptance tests are run separately with `go test -coverpkg=./internal/... ./acceptance-tests/...`,
  write a second report to `acceptance-coverage.out`, and gate the `build` task. The two coverage
  files are intentionally separate signals: `coverage.out` measures branch-level unit test
  correctness; `acceptance-coverage.out` measures which internal lines are reachable end-to-end.
